    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My mother's recipe for beef stew is one that will always hold a special place in my heart. I have so many fond memories of coming home from school to find the house filled with its scent. It's a bowl of comfort, really.</p>
    <p>Hey, here's a second paragraph because the curriculum says I need to add one, but I don't really feel like coming up with additional content just now!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Stew Meat</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Small Onion, Quartered</li>
        <li>1 Envelope Onion Soup Mix</li>
        <li>¾ Cup White Flour</li>
        <li>½ Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>½ Teaspoon Pepper</li>
        <li>½ Teaspoon Garlic</li>
        <li>3 Cups Beef Broth</li>
        <li>1 Cup Carrots, Chopped</li>
        <li>3 Medium Potatos, Peeled, Quartered</li>
        <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together and put into a large ziplock bag:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Put stew meat into bag and toss to coat well.</li>
        <li>On the stove, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet at medium heat. Add the stew meat, and brown on all sides (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>In order, place potatoes, carrots, onions, and beef into the slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Pour broth over the top. If it does not fully cover ingredients, feel free to add additional broth or water, depending on preference.</li>
        <li>Add bay leaves and onion soup packet.</li>
        <li>Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Cook on low (recommended) for 8-10 hours or on high for 4-6 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    If desired, steps 1 and 2 can be completed in advance, as can the preparation of the vegetables. Refrigerate the cooked beef for up to 24 hours prior to use. Potatoes must be placed into either broth or water (peeled potatoes will turn brown if not kept in liquid). With all elements prepared, begin with step 5 for an easy, quick start.
