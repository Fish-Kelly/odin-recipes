    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe became a favorite of my family's during the early days of the Covid Pandemic. It's warm, comforting, and full of protein. Here is more text about this recipe so that I can fill up a lot of space and make this look more legitimate. I'm continuing to type because I really want this to be longer. However, I do think it would be absolutely delightful if more recipe blogs nixed the lengthy descriptions and just got down to brass tacks.</p>
    <p>This is a test second paragraph to make sure I've formatted things correctly. Let me take this opportunity to say that I truly hope you're having a wonderful day, and that the weather in your part of the world is agreeable.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>

        <li>1 (14 oz) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 diced green chile pepper, or to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Combine sweet potatoes, tomatoes, curry powder, chili powder, and cumin in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add coconut milk, spinach, chile pepper, bouillon cube, and chili jam. Simmer until curry starts to thicken and has cooked down a little, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fry halloumi in a skillet over medium heat until browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add cooked halloumi and chickpeas to curry and heat through, about 5 minutes.</li>
