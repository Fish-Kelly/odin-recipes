    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This recipe became a favorite of my family's during the early days of the Covid Pandemic. It's warm, comforting, and full of protein. Here is more text about this recipe so that I can fill up a lot of space and make this look more legitimate. I'm continuing to type because I really want this to be longer. However, I do think it would be absolutely delightful if more recipe blogs nixed the lengthy descriptions and just got down to brass tacks.</p>
